# Introduction
This project uses Proteus to design and simulate a 4-bit binary counter with D flip-flops, demonstrating core concepts of digital logic and sequential circuit design. It incrementally counts from 0 to 15, supporting reset and pause functions for controlled operation.

# Explanation
The counter is built through a structured approach involving circuit design, component selection, and integration of logic gates. A 7-segment display shows real-time output, while the simulation ensures accurate state transitions. Key applications include memory addressing and clock division in digital systems. The project emphasizes circuit efficiency, scalability, and ease of implementation. A comparative analysis of clocking logic examines variations in power usage, delay, and design complexity. This practical implementation offers valuable insights into embedded systems and digital circuit behavior.
